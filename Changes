Version 0.8

    * Implemented an error handling mechanism which allows the presentation of
      non-fatal warnings to the caller, but also causes Archive::Tar::Builder
      to exit cleanly in otherwise fatal conditions; simple permissions issues
      while building an archive will no longer stop the stream

    * Allow caller to suppress warn()ings when archiving files

Version 0.7

    * No functional changes; drop unnecessary dependencies from PREREQ_PM in
      Makefile.PL

Version 0.6

    * No functional changes; adds build and test support for Perl 5.6 toolchains
      with the help of a variety of very ugly hacks in various places in unit
      test t/lib-Archive-Tar-Builder.t

Version 0.5

    * Feature-for-feature reimplementation in C with a small XS layer
    * Remove option of "GNU extensions"; GNU extensions are now always available
      and use is implied
    * Slightly better adherence to POSIX ustar header format, such as with ustar
      header magic

Version 0.4

    Resolve an issue of build-time modules in mk/ being picked up by
    CPAN's indexer, resulting in an "UNAUTHORIZED RELEASE" warning, by declaring
    the PMLIBDIRS value in Makefile.PL to include only 'lib', and using a trick
    (thanks RURBAN!) to cause the PAUSE indexer to not pick up the package
    declarations in the files in mk/

Version 0.3

    Initial release
