Version 0.3

    Initial release

Version 0.4

    Resolve an issue of build-time modules in mk/ being picked up by
    CPAN's indexer, resulting in an "UNAUTHORIZED RELEASE" warning, by declaring
    the PMLIBDIRS value in Makefile.PL to include only 'lib', and using a trick
    (thanks RURBAN!) to cause the PAUSE indexer to not pick up the package
    declarations in the files in mk/
